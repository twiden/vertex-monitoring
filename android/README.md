# Monitoring with Vertx.io

This is an Android Studio project. It is easiest to open and run it from Android Studio.

I've never written an android app before so it is on a learners level of quality. But it is a working frontend.

Features

* Update button: Updates the list (it does not auto refresh)

* List of services with name, status, time of last check and a delete button.

* Form at the bottom of the list to add new services. (After adding a service you need to wait a bit and then hit Update for the supervisor process to check the status)
